  "description": "Your company receives a new project that needs some work done. The client has a blog that allows authors to sign-up and write articles, but it needs some new features that your company needs to implement:\r - They want to start using Ansistrano to deploy the blog.\r - Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to give a basic layout to the blog. Remember to optimize the load of css and js files.\r - Authors should be able to upload their profile picture when creating their account. Upload these images to Amazon S3.\r - The home page should show the top 5 articles, according to the visits received. This ranking has two different views: global ranking; and currently logged user articles ranking. Use Redis to create this ranking.",
